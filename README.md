# Reinforcement Learning Taxi-v3 Environment

This project demonstrates the use of reinforcement learning to train an intelligent agent to solve the Taxi-v3 problem from OpenAI Gym. The agent learns to pick up and drop off passengers at designated locations in the shortest amount of time possible.

## Overview

The Taxi-v3 environment simulates a simple grid world where the agent (taxi) needs to pick up passengers from one location and drop them off at another while navigating obstacles on the grid. The agent learns to accomplish this task efficiently by employing Q-learning, a popular reinforcement learning algorithm.

## Key Features

- Utilizes Q-learning for training the agent
- Implements Taxi-v3 environment from OpenAI Gym
- Provides visualization of the agent's progress using `matplotlib`

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- OpenAI Gym
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
